# airbnb-clone-project
This is the repository for the airbnb clone project for Alx pro dev course
The goal of this project is to create an airbnb clone, ny uding django, MYSQL, GRAPHQL

Team Roles
1. Backend Developer: The backend developer will be responsible for implementing the API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic for the airbnb project.
2. Database Administrator: The database administrator will manage the database design, indexing, and optimizations for the project.
3. DevOps Engineer: The DevOps engineer will handle the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4. QA Engineer: The QA Enginerr will ensure the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality. standards.

Technology Stack
1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Database Design
1. User ↔ Property:
One user (host) can have many properties.
User (1) → (∞) Property

2. User ↔ Booking:
One user (guest) can make many bookings.
User (1) → (∞) Booking

3. Property ↔ Booking:
One property can have many bookings over time.
Property (1) → (∞) Booking

4. Booking ↔ Payment:
One booking has one corresponding payment.
Booking (1) → (1) Payment

5. Property ↔ Review:
One property can have many reviews.
Property (1) → (∞) Review

6. User ↔ Review:
One user (guest) can write many reviews.
User (1) → (∞) Review


Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
This feature provides secure user registration, login/logout, and profile management. It ensures that only authenticated users can access and interact with the platform, with personalized features based on their roles (e.g., guest or host).

2. Property Management
Enables users (typically hosts) to create, update, and manage property listings. This feature ensures that accurate and up-to-date information is available to potential guests for informed decision-making.

3. Booking System
Allows guests to reserve properties and manage booking details such as dates and booking status. It connects users with available properties and prevents double bookings through date validation and availability checks.

4. Payment Processing
Facilitates secure online payments for property bookings and stores relevant transaction details. This feature ensures financial transparency, user trust, and smooth revenue flow for property owners.

5. Review System
Lets users leave ratings and written feedback for properties they've booked. It builds credibility and trust on the platform by helping other users make informed decisions based on past guest experiences.

6. Data Optimization
Focuses on structuring the database and queries to allow fast and efficient data retrieval and storage. This ensures that the application remains scalable and performs well even as the user base and data volume grow.


API Security
1. Authentication
What It Is:
Verifies user identity through secure login systems (e.g., hashed passwords, multi-factor authentication).

Why It Matters:
Ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive user data and actions like booking or payment.

2. Authorization
What It Is:
Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do based on their roles (e.g., host vs. guest).

Why It Matters:
Prevents users from performing actions they shouldn’t have access to — for example, a guest trying to edit or delete another user's property listing.

3. Data Encryption (At Rest and In Transit)
What It Is:
Secures sensitive data like passwords and payment details using HTTPS and database-level encryption.

Why It Matters:
Protects user data from being exposed during transmission or if the database is compromised, boosting trust and compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).

4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
What It Is:
Limits the number of requests a user or bot can make in a given time frame.

Why It Matters:
Protects the platform from brute-force attacks, abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by controlling traffic flow.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization
What It Is:
Ensures all inputs from users (e.g., forms, URLs) are clean and expected before processing.

Why It Matters:
Prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), safeguarding data integrity and system behavior.

6. Secure Payment Gateway Integration
What It Is:
Uses trusted third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, Paystack) to handle transactions securely.

Why It Matters:
Protects financial information and reduces the risk of fraud or mishandling of payment data.

7. Regular Backups & Data Recovery Plans
What It Is:
Routine database backups and recovery procedures in case of data loss or breach.

Why It Matters:
Ensures that critical information (e.g., bookings, payments) is not permanently lost and can be restored quickly.
